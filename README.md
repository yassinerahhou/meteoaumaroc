Features:

Search any African city: Get up-to-date weather information for any city or location in Africa.
Comprehensive weather data: View detailed weather information including temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Responsive design: Enjoy a seamless user experience on any device, whether desktop or mobile.
Getting Started

(or yarn install if using yarn)

Create an OpenWeatherMap API Key:

Visit https://openweathermap.org/api and create an account.
Go to your API keys and create a new key.
Store your API key securely (not in the codebase).
Configure the API Key (Environment Variables):

Create a .env file in the project root directory (ignore this file in version control).

Add the following line to the .env file, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key:

REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
You can use environment variable loading libraries like dotenv to access the API key in your React components.

Running the Application:

Start the development server:

Bash
npm start
Utilisez ce code avec précaution.
content_copy
(or yarn start)

The application will typically open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/ (or a similar address).

Development

The project uses a hot reloading development server for efficient development. Changes in your code will be reflected in the browser automatically, allowing for a faster development workflow.

Deployment

The provided npm run build script creates an optimized production build of your application in the build folder. This build is minified and ready for deployment to a hosting platform of your choice.
